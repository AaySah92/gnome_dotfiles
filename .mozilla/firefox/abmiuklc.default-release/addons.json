We have extensive filters that filter against annoying display and video ads (including YouTube).\n\nUnlike other ad blockers, we do not have “acceptable ads” or an advertiser whitelist (i.e. certain advertisers pay to bypass ad filters). Blocking ads has the added benefit of speeding up browsing because filtering out ads reduces CPU and memory usage.\n\nAdBlocker Ultimate allows you to easily accept ads from websites you choose, in cases where you want to give advertising credit to certain trusted websites.\n\n*** Types of ads we block ***\n- Text ads\n- Banner ads\n- Pop-up ads\n- Pop-under ads\n- Overlay ads\n- Interstitial page ads\n- Video ads\n- Webmail ads\n- Facebook ads\n\n*** Benefits of ad blocking ***\n- Improve browser speed\n- Improve page load speed\n- Decrease memory usage\n- Decrease bandwidth\n\n*** Open Source ***\nAdBlocker Ultimate is an open source project:\nhttps://github.com/adblockultimate/\n\n*** Found a bug? ***\nUse the Report a Problem form:\nhttps://adblockultimate.net/report.html\n\n\nAlso available on:\nGoogle Chrome: Visit website\nMicrosoft Edge Visit website\niPhone and iPad: Visit website\nMac: Visit website\nOpera: Visit website\nYandex: Visit website\nWindows OS: Visit website","weeklyDownloads":93525,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"AdAvoid","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11962448/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/240/240036.png?modified=1622132367","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/240/240036.jpg?modified=1622132367","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/240/240037.png?modified=1622132373","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/240/240037.jpg?modified=1622132373","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/240/240038.png?modified=1622132378","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/240/240038.jpg?modified=1622132378","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/240/240039.png?modified=1622132384","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/240/240039.jpg?modified=1622132384","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/adblocker/10?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.7782,"reviewCount":7610,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblocker-ultimate/reviews/","updateDate":1685019024000},{"id":"jid1-KKzOGWgsW3Ao4Q@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/481/481438-32.png?modified=1682583894","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/481/481438-64.png?modified=1682583894","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/481/481438-128.png?modified=1682583894"},"name":"I don't care about cookies","version":"3.4.8","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4150668/i_dont_care_about_cookies-3.4.8.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/","supportURL":"https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/","description":"Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!","fullDescription":"The EU regulations require that any website using tracking cookies must get user's permission before installing them.
